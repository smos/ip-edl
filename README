This is a dynamic IP list generator.
Depending on the arguments you get the IP4/IP6 addresses listed for countries or ASN numbers 

Usage: Valid arguments are: asn, country. Seperate multiple values with Semicolon.
Do note that platforms limits might be easily exceeded with this.

ASN
feed.php?asn=1136;33915
Country
feed.php?country=NL;DE
Both
feed.php?country=NL;DE&asn=1136;33915

You can peruse the raw input data https://iserv.nl/files/edl/in/ directory and see what came https://iserv.nl/files/edl/out/, although the feed script is probably easier to integrate.
This script came about after missing IPv6 GEO location functionality in Palo Alto (=<10.1.11) which is ... weird.
It is also way easier to setup a ASN blocklist for questionable hosting such as "Limenet"  https://bgp.tools/as/394711
